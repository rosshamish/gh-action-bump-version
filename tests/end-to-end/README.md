# Tests

To set up tests, you need:

1. Blank public Github repo, and its URL in the form https://github.com/user-name/repo-name.git
2. Personal Access Token (PAT) with "workflows" access rights.
3. Username of the account for which the PAT belongs to.

Add these as Repository Secrets in the repo, with names `TEST_REPO`, `TEST_TOKEN`, and `TEST_USER`, respectively.
